# Resilient Decentralized Edge Learning via Sentinel-Based Fault Localization and Containment

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

**“Resilient Decentralized Edge Learning via Sentinel-Based Fault Localization and Containment”**

accepted at **IDC 2026 — 18th International Symposium on Intelligent Distributed Computing**.

## Overview

This code implements a sentinel-based resilience framework for decentralized edge learning. The setting consists of multiple IoT/edge nodes, where each node trains a local LSTM predictor on its own time-series observations and exchanges only model parameters with neighboring nodes through gossip-based communication.

The framework examines the case in which a hidden fault is injected into a single unmonitored node. The corrupted model state can then propagate to neighboring nodes through parameter exchange. To limit this effect, a subset of monitored nodes, called **sentinels**, tracks local prediction residuals, raises alarms when abnormal behavior is detected, estimates the likely fault source using graph distances and alarm timings, and heals affected nodes using healthy neighbors.

The experimental case study uses real Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements from the CityLab testbed within the FED4FIRE+ federation.

| `M/N` | `5/27` | Sentinel-to-node ratio, controlling the degree of partial observability. |
| `r_max` | `L / 5` | Communication radius used to define graph neighbors. |

| `seq_len` | `15` | Sliding-window length used by the LSTM predictor. |
| `B` | `100` | Number of RSSI samples processed per node at each communication round. |
| `R` | `min_len // B` | Number of communication rounds, computed from the shortest RSSI stream and the batch length. |
| `local_epochs` | `5` | Number of local training epochs performed by each node per communication round. |

| `hidden_dim` | `32` | Number of hidden units in the LSTM layer. |
| `layer_dim` | `1` | Number of stacked LSTM layers. |

| `drift_round` | `25` | Communication round at which the hidden fault is introduced. |
| `warmup_rounds` | `20` | Number of initial fault-free rounds used to establish nominal sentinel residual behavior. |
| `fault_weight_shift` | `5.0` | Additive perturbation applied to the output-layer weights of the faulty node. |
| `fault_bias_shift` | `2.5` | Additive perturbation applied to the output-layer bias of the faulty node. |
| `mode` | `"all"` | Applies the output-layer perturbation to all relevant output parameters. |
